# Lissajous Curve Table
A Lissajous curve is a complex figure formed by the combination of two perpendicular harmonic motions. These curves are defined by the equations:
- x(t) = A.sin(a.t + δ)
- y(t) = B.sin(b.t)

A and B are the amplitudes, a and b are the frequencies, and δ is the phase difference.

## Applications:
- Physics: Used to analyze oscillatory motion.
- Engineering: In signal processing and waveform generation.
- Art: Creates visually appealing patterns in graphic design.
